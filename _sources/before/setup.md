# Setup: get ready for the workshop

The workshop goal is to provide a wide introduction to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and some core EOSC services. Follow the steps below to get access to the EOSC services we will be using during the practicals.

## Register to EOSC services the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) 

First, before the workshop, all the participants will have to create an EGI account, register to [ROHub](https://www.rohub.org/) (Data management platform), enroll to the the Virtual Organisations to have access to EOSC EGI JupyterHub and/or EOSC EGI BinderHub.

There are several steps to follow:

1. Sign up for an EGI account:  [https://aai.egi.eu/signup](https://aai.egi.eu/signup). We recommend to use  your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) account to authenticate (create an ORCID account if you do not have one yet).
2. Enroll to the **vo.notebooks.egi.eu** VO by clicking on [https://aai.egi.eu/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:111](https://aai.egi.eu/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:111). This will take you to the website shown on the Figure ![EGI account](../figures/EGI-VO.png) and then to ![EGI join VO notebook](../figures/EGI-join-VO.png). For the latter e.g. when asking to join the EGI VO notebook,  in the "statement for purpose" simply write “**Attending EOSC Future training workshop in North Macedonia in September 2023**”. Review and agree on the policy and click on “Submit”. Once your enrollment has been validated you will have access to [/https://replay.notebooks.egi.eu/](https://replay.notebooks.egi.eu/) (it requires you to authenticate using EGI Check-in credentials), a service building on BinderHub but with more compute resources than [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/).
3. Register to [ROHub](https://www.rohub.org/) by clicking on "Sign-up" (top right button) at [https://www.rohub.org/](https://www.rohub.org/). You will be re-directed to a webpage where you can select EGI-Check in to register. If you want to get more information, visit the [ROHub Authentication](https://reliance-eosc.github.io/rohub-portal-documentation/docs/ROHub-authentication) documentation.


:::{note}
It is **important** to perform all these steps **as early as possible** in order for managers of the Virtual Organisations to approve your petitions to join (which may **take several days**).
:::

Once your enrollments have been validated, you may need to log out from EGI Check-in to refresh your account. If you have any trouble, request help by [filling an issue](https://github.com/annefou/EOSC-Future-Training-North-Macedonia/issues/new) before the workshop. Someone will assist you with the setup.
