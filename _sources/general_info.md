## The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)

![EOSC logo](./figures/EOSC_logo-small.png)

The [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://eosc-portal.eu/about/eosc) aims at becoming the main environment for hosting and processing research data to support European Science. 

The ambition of EOSC is to have a **federated** and **open multi-disciplinary** environment where you can publish, find and re-use data, tools and services for research, innovation and educational purposes. 
There is not one unique cloud provider offering all the EOSC compute and storage resources: an [onboarding process](https://eosc-portal.eu/providers-documentation/eosc-provider-portal-basic-guide) has been defined to allow new resource providers to register their services to EOSC.

EOSC is still under development and it is often difficult to understand what is made available to you or what will be made available. 
On the other hand, as a researcher, innovator, company or citizen you can contribute to build it, for instance by providing feedback on the available tools and services. 

EOSC is run as a [co-programmed European Partnership under Horizon Europe from 2021](https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe/european-partnerships-horizon-europe/candidates-across-themes_en). [Horizon Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe_en) is the European Commission's research and innovation funding programme (started in 2021 and succeeding the Horizon 2020 European programme).
